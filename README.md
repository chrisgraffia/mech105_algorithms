# Mech 105 Algorithms
This repository contains all the algorithms that I created as homework assignments during my time in Mech 105 from January 2019 to May 2019. These are all completely original codes created 100% by me.
## Homework Assignments
In this folder you can find all of the more specific homework assignments I was given throughout the semester. These algorithms were usually given with instructions that were more precise that wanted the code written in more particular ways. The original codes have been slighty adjusted to make more sense for those who did not receive the particular instructions like I did.
## Numerical Method Algorithms
This folder contains the more complex algorithms that took me much more effort and time than those found in the homework assignments folder. The three codes are user-defined functions that are designed to handle any circumstances where the algorithm is applicable.
