# Homework Assignments
## Days
This function will output the total number of days elapsed given the number of months completed, number of days completed, and whether or not it is a leap year.
## Density of Freshwater
This algorithm calculates the density of freshwater with respect to temperature. The function was predefined in the homework assignment. A graph is output at the end to show density vs temperature.
## Discharging Capacitor
This algorithm graphs the total charge on a capacitor over time. The equation was given in the original assignment.
## Machine Epsilon
This algorithm finds machine epsilon by starting with 1 and continually halving the number until a rounding error occurs.
## Probability Function
This algorithm simply graphs a predefined standard deviation function.
## Smallest Positive Number
This algorithm finds the smallest positive number a computer can store by continually halving 1 until right before the number rounds to zero.
## Volume in a Tank
This algorithm finds the volume in a predefined tank with specific measurements after the user inputs the height of the liquid.
