# Numerical Method Algorithms
## False Position
This algorithm is a user-defined function that uses the numerical method of false position to determine the root of a given function. The user must also input an upper bound and a lower bound, and the user has the option to input an approximate relative error and maximum number of iterations. If the user chooses to not input the error or iterations, the function will automatically choose the values. The function will output the final approximate relative error, the number of iterations completed, and the evaluated root of the function.
